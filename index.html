<p>There is nothing here... have a random haiku error message:</p>
<div id="haiku"></div>

<script>
var haiku = [
"A file that big?<br/>It might be very useful.<br/>But now it is gone.",
"Stay the patient course<br/>Of little worth is your ire<br/>The network is down",
"Three things are certain:<br/>Death, taxes, and lost data.<br/>Guess which has occurred.",
"You step in the stream,<br/>but the water has moved on.<br/>This page is not here.",
"Out of memory.<br/>We wish to hold the whole sky,<br/>But we never will.",
"Having been erased,<br/>The document you're seeking<br/>Must now be retyped.",
"Rather than a beep<br/>Or a rude error message,<br/>These words: \"File not found.\"",
"Serious error.<br/>All shortcuts have disappeared.<br/>Screen. Mind. Both are blank.",
"The Web site you seek<br/>cannot be located but<br/>endless others exist",
"Chaos reigns within.<br/>Reflect, repent, and reboot.<br/>Order shall return.",
"ABORTED effort:<br/>Close all that you have.<br/>You ask way too much.",
"First snow, then silence.<br/>This thousand dollar screen dies<br/>so beautifully.",
"With searching comes loss<br/>and the presence of absence:<br/>\"My Novel\" not found.",
"The Tao that is seen<br/>Is not the true Tao, until<br/>You bring fresh toner.",
"A crash reduces<br/>your expensive computer<br/>to a simple stone.",
"Error messages<br/>cannot completely convey.<br/>We now know shared loss."
